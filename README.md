**getOperate** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline internal operations by offering a range of tools and features. It provides over 6,000 templates for users to explore and offers generative workflows, allowing users to create custom workflows using a visual builder with drag-and-drop functionality. The platform emphasizes automation, enabling users to automate tasks and processes, from simple actions to building entire automated systems. Integration with Salesforce allows for triggers and actions, such as responding when a new record is created. Additionally, there's integration with application for sending summaries and action buttons for approval. Users can customize workflows according to their specific business needs.

The getOperate tool is developed by [dData](https://th.linkedin.com/company/ddataco) the company where **I interned from March to April in 2024**.
